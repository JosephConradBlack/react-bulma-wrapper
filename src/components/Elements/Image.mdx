# Image

<PropsTable of={Image} />

Use an Image to specify to a precisely sized container to ensure your page layout isn't broken during image loading.

<Playground>
    <Image src={placeholderImage} size={128} />
</Playground>

## Rounded Images

You can also make rounded images.

<Playground>
    <Image src={placeholderImage} size={128} rounded />
</Playground>

## Responsive images with radio

The size property also supports the 16 ratio modifiers. This will
cause the image container to take up the full-width available whilst maintaining the aspect ratio.

These properties are useful if you don't know the exact dimensions of the image.

<Playground>
    <Image src={placeholderImage} size='square' />

</Playground>
